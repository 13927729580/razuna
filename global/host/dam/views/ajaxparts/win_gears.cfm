		<h1>Razuna UpDrive</h1>
		<p>Razuna UpDrive is a technology based on <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/" target="_blank">Gears</a>, which adds offline capabilities to your web browser.<br /><br />
		After you install and enable the plugin most of Razuna's images, scripts, and CSS files will be stored locally on your computer. This speeds up page load time.<br /><br />
		We advise you to not install this on a public or shared computer.<br /><br />
